<blockquote><i>"Throughout my life I have been blessed by my membership and 
participation in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
It is impossible to describe all the ways the Church has blessed my life and the 
lives of those I love. But I will give a few examples, in the hope that this will 
add personal persuasion to the principles described".

Colombia, and my wife is from Ecuador. I have been studying Computer Science 
for two years, and it is the most amazing experience any student can live.
I decided to come to the US because the high educational level of many
Universities here, specially in the field of Technology. It is a real
privilege to be here, and most important to be studying at BYU-Idaho, I love

One of passions is doing Family History, I really love to help my ancestors
to perform the gospel ordinances, and at the same time it strengthened me
spiritually. My testimony has been built based on my spiritual experiences
